Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__thumb/img/BUOso8b0M1aUOkU80FWlhE8uuxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7149798.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__original/img/jt70jJDZ1y1FWJs4ZQf5FI8APVY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7149798.jpg,"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Economic']","['Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Neighbor Scope', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Ancient: Babylon', 'Ancient: Egypt', 'Ancient: Greece', 'Category: Dized Tutorial', 'Constructions: Pyramids', 'Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena', 'Digital Implementations: BrettspielWelt', 'Digital Implementations: Google Play', 'Game: 7 Wonders', 'Mechanism: Artificial Player', 'Mechanism: Tableau Building', 'Misc: Watch It Played How To Videos']",91,104612,7.68293,7.5736

Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.<br/><br/>Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.<br/><br/>Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.<br/><br/>Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.<br/><br/>",https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__thumb/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg,https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/HZYRVZoUtl7COYnS0NvXNSuaf80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760568.jpg,"['Economic', 'Farming', 'Medieval']","['Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Set Collection', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']","['Digital Implementations: Tabletopia', 'Game: Village']",221,23321,7.49264,7.30231

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.<br/><br/>At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot.

Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.<br/><br/>In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...<br/><br/>In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.<br/>    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.<br/>    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.<br/>    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.<br/>    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.<br/><br/><br/>When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends.
